# Rust and Actix Web - JWT Access and Refresh Tokens

This guide will walk you through the process of implementing RS256 JWT authentication with Rust, using asymmetric keys (private and public keys) to ensure strong security. The API will be hosted on a high-performance Actix Web server and will store data in a PostgreSQL database.
